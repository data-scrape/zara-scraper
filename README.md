## What this project is for

`zara-scraper` is an implementation-focused Python project for collecting public Zara data. It is designed around one practical job: turn a query such as **"wireless headphones"** into structured records you can inspect, export, and pass into an automation workflow.

### Typical output

- product names, prices, availability, seller details, ratings, and review counts
- JSON or CSV files for downstream analysis
- Explicit timestamps and source links for traceability

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py --query "wireless headphones" --output results.json --max-results 100
```

To run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/data-scrape/zara-scraper.git
cd zara-scraper
python scraper.py --query "wireless headphones" --format csv --output results.csv
```

## Example record

```json
{
  "query": "wireless headphones",
  "result": {
    "title": "Example public result",
    "source_url": "https://example.com/item/123",
    "captured_at": "2026-08-11T09:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {"platform": "Zara", "category": "E-commerce Scrapers"}
  }
}
```

## Workflow ideas

| Goal | Start here |
|---|---|
| Price Monitoring | Query a narrow audience, category, or location first |
| Build a repeatable dataset | Save JSON, version your query, then schedule a refresh |
| Connect to an AI workflow | Normalize the output schema before passing it to an agent or RAG pipeline |
| Scale data collection | Respect platform rules, add conservative delays, and measure error rates |

## Responsible use

This project is intended for public data and legitimate research or automation workflows. Review the target platform's terms, applicable laws, and your data-handling obligations before running a collection job. Do not use it to access private data or evade access controls.


## CoreClaw for production workflows

When a proof of concept needs production-grade web data APIs rather than self-managed collection infrastructure, [CoreClaw](https://www.coreclaw.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=L7&utm_term=&utm_id=L7) provides API-first access to public web data for AI agents and automation.
